# Overview

**Alliance Auth** (AA) is a website that helps Eve Online organizations efficiently manage access to applications and external services.

It has the following key features:

- Automatically grants or revokes users access to external services (e.g. Discord, Mumble) and web apps (e.g. SRP requests) based on the user's current membership to [in-game organizations](/features/core/states) and [groups](/features/core/groups)

- Provides a central website where users can directly access web apps (e.g., SRP requests) and manage their access to external services and groups.

- Includes a set of connectors (called ["services"](/features/services/index)) for integrating access management with many popular external services like Discord, Mumble, Teamspeak 3, SMF and others

- Includes a set of web [apps](/features/apps/index) which add many useful functions, e.g.: fleet schedule, timer board, SRP request management, fleet activity tracker

- It can be easily extended with additional services and apps. Many are provided by the [community](/features/community/index).

- Chinese, English, German and Spanish localization
