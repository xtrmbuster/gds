sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ unzip git redis curl bzip2-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel wget pkg-config
```

```shell
sudo systemctl enable redis.service
sudo systemctl start redis.service
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 8

```shell
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ unzip git redis curl bzip2-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel wget
```

```shell
sudo systemctl enable redis.service
sudo systemctl start redis.service
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 9

```shell
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ unzip git redis curl bzip2-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel wget
```

```shell
sudo systemctl enable redis.service
sudo systemctl start redis.service
```

:::

## Database Setup

Alliance Auth needs a MySQL user account and database. Open an SQL shell with

```shell
sudo mysql -u root
```

and create them as follows, replacing `PASSWORD` with an actual secure password:

```sql
CREATE USER 'allianceserver'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
CREATE DATABASE alliance_auth CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON alliance_auth . * TO 'allianceserver'@'localhost';
```

Once your database is set up, you can leave the SQL shell with `exit`.

Add timezone tables to your mysql installation:

```shell
mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | sudo mysql -u root mysql
```

:::{note}
You may see errors when you add the timezone tables. To make sure that they were correctly added run the following commands and check for the ``time_zone`` tables

```shell
mysql -u root -p
use mysql;
show tables;
```

:::

Close the SQL shell and secure your database server with this command:

```shell
mysql_secure_installation
```

## Auth Install

### User Account

For security and permissions, itâ€™s highly recommended you create a separate user to install auth under. Do not log in as this account.
::::{tabs}

:::{group-tab} Ubuntu 2004, 2204

```shell
sudo adduser --disabled-login allianceserver
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS 7

```shell
sudo passwd -l allianceserver
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 8

```shell
sudo passwd -l allianceserver
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 9

```shell
sudo passwd -l allianceserver
```

:::
::::

### Prepare Directories

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/myauth/static
```

```shell
sudo chown -R allianceserver:allianceserver /var/www/myauth/static/
```

:::{warning}
When installing and performing maintenance on Alliance Auth, virtual environments and python packages, _sudo_ means _superuser_ _do_, this will not use your venv or your allianceserver user and will routinely break your permission structure.

Only use sudo for _system_ management or if you are unsure, when explicitly instructed to do so.

```shell
sudo su allianceserver
```

:::

### Virtual Environment

Switch to the allianceserver user.

```shell
sudo su allianceserver
```

And switch to its home directory:

```shell
cd ~
```

Create a Python virtual environment and put it somewhere convenient (e.g. `/home/allianceserver/venv/auth/`)

:::{note}
Your python3.x command/version may vary depending on your installed python version.
:::

```shell
python3.11 -m venv /home/allianceserver/venv/auth/
```

:::{tip}
A virtual environment provides support for creating a lightweight "copy" of Python with their own site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (allowing creation of environments with various Python versions) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories. You can read more about virtual environments on the Python_ docs. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>
:::

Activate the virtual environment with (Note the `/bin/activate` on the end of the path):

```shell
source /home/allianceserver/venv/auth/bin/activate
```

:::{hint}
Each time you come to do maintenance on your Alliance Auth installation, you should activate your virtual environment first. When finished, deactivate it with the ``deactivate`` command.
:::

### Eve Online SSO

You need to have a dedicated Eve SSO app for Alliance auth. Please go to [EVE Developer](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications) to create one.

For **scopes** your SSO app needs to have at least `publicData`. Additional scopes depend on which Alliance Auth apps you will be using. For convenience, we recommend adding all available ESO scopes to your SSO app. Note that Alliance Auth will always ask the users to approve specific scopes before they are used.

As **callback URL** you want to define the URL of your Alliance Auth site plus the route: `/sso/callback`. Example for a valid callback URL: `https://auth.example.com/sso/callback`

### Alliance Auth Project

:::{warning}
Before installing any Python packages, please double-check that you have activated in the virtual environment. This is usually indicated by your command line in the terminal starting with: `(auth)`.
:::

#### Install Python packages

Update & install basic tools before installing further Python packages:

```shell
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

You can install **Alliance Auth** with the following command. This will install AA, AA's Python dependencies, superlance for memory monitoring and gunicorn as a wsgi server

```shell
pip install allianceauth superlance gunicorn
```

#### Create the Alliance Auth project

Now you need to create the Django project that will run **Alliance Auth**. Ensure you are in the allianceserver home directory by issuing:

```shell
cd /home/allianceserver
```

The following command bootstraps a Django project which will run your **Alliance Auth** instance. You can rename it from `myauth` to anything you'd like. Note that this name is shown by default as the site name but that can be changed later.

```shell
allianceauth start myauth
```

#### Update settings

Your settings file needs configuring:

```shell
nano myauth/myauth/settings/local.py
```

**Be sure to configure:**

- Your site URL as `SITE_URL`
- The database user account setup from earlier in [Database Setup](#database-setup)
- `ESI_SSO_CLIENT_ID`, `ESI_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET` from the EVE Online Developers Portal from earlier in [Eve Online SSO](#eve-online-sso)
- `ESI_USER_CONTACT_EMAIL` to an email address to ensure that CCP has reliable contact information for you
- Valid email server settings

#### Install database & static files

Django needs to set up the database before it can start.

```shell
python /home/allianceserver/myauth/manage.py migrate
```

Now we need to round up all the static files required to render templates. Make a directory to serve them from and populate it.

```shell
python /home/allianceserver/myauth/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Check to ensure your settings are valid.

```shell
python /home/allianceserver/myauth/manage.py check
```

:::{hint}
If you are using root, ensure the allianceserver user has read/write permissions to this directory before proceeding::

```shell
chown -R allianceserver:allianceserver /home/allianceserver/myauth
```

:::

#### Setup superuser

Before using your auth site, it is essential to create a superuser account. This account will have all permissions in Alliance Auth. It's OK to use this as your personal auth account.

```shell
python /home/allianceserver/myauth/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once your installation is complete, the superuser account is accessed by logging in via the admin site at `https://example.com/admin`.

If you intend to use this account as your personal auth account, you need to add a main character. Navigate to the normal user dashboard (at `https://example.com`) after logging in via the admin site and select `Change Main`. Once a main character has been added, it is possible to use SSO to log in to this account.

## Services

Alliance Auth needs some additional services to run, which we will set up and configure next.

### Gunicorn

To run the **Alliance Auth** website, a [WSGI Server](https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html) is required. For this [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) is highly recommended for its ease of configuring. It can be manually run from within your `myauth` base directory with `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0 myauth.wsgi` or automatically run using Supervisor.

If you don't see any errors, this means that Gunicorn is running fine. You can stop it with `Ctrl+C` now.

The default configuration is good enough for most installations. Additional information is available in the [gunicorn](gunicorn.md) doc.

### Supervisor

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is a process watchdog service: it makes sure other processes are started automatically and kept running. It can be used to automatically start the WSGI server and Celery workers for background tasks.

:::{note}
    You will need to exit the allianceserver user back to a user with sudo capabilities to install supervisor::

```shell
exit
```

:::

::::{tabs}

:::{group-tab} Ubuntu 2004, 2204

```shell
sudo apt-get install supervisor
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS 7

```shell
sudo dnf install supervisor
```

```shell
sudo systemctl enable supervisord.service
```

```shell
sudo systemctl start supervisord.service
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 8

```shell
sudo dnf install supervisor
```

```shell
sudo systemctl enable supervisord.service
```

```shell
sudo systemctl start supervisord.service
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 9

```shell
sudo dnf install supervisor
```

```shell
sudo systemctl enable supervisord.service
```

```shell
sudo systemctl start supervisord.service
```

:::
::::

Once installed, it needs a configuration file to know which processes to watch. Your Alliance Auth project comes with a ready-to-use template which will ensure the Celery workers, Celery task scheduler and Gunicorn are all running.
::::{tabs}

:::{group-tab} Ubuntu 2004, 2204

```shell
ln -s /home/allianceserver/myauth/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/myauth.conf
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS 7

```shell
sudo ln -s /home/allianceserver/myauth/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisord.d/myauth.ini
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 8

```shell
sudo ln -s /home/allianceserver/myauth/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisord.d/myauth.ini
```

:::
:::{group-tab} CentOS Stream 9

```shell
sudo ln -s /home/allianceserver/myauth/supervisor.conf /etc/supervisord.d/myauth.ini
```

:::
::::

Activate it with `sudo supervisorctl reload`.

You can check the status of the processes with `sudo supervisorctl status`. Logs from these processes are available in `/home/allianceserver/myauth/log` named by process.

:::{note}
Any time the code or your settings change, you'll need to restart Gunicorn and Celery. ::

```shell
sudo supervisorctl restart myauth:
```

:::

## Web server

Once installed, decide on whether you're going to use [NGINX](nginx.md) or [Apache](apache.md) and follow the respective guide.

Note that Alliance Auth is designed to run with web servers on HTTPS. While running on HTTP is technically possible, it is not recommended for production use, and some functions (e.g., Email confirmation links) will not work properly.

## Updating

Periodically [new releases](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth/tags) are issued with bug fixes and new features. Be sure to read the [release notes](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth/-/releases) which will highlight changes.

To update your installation, swap to your allianceserver user

```shell
sudo su allianceserver
```

Activate your virtual environment

```shell
source /home/allianceserver/venv/auth/bin/activate
```

and update with:

```shell
pip install -U allianceauth
```

Some releases come with changes to the base settings. Update your project's settings with:

```shell
allianceauth update /home/allianceserver/myauth
```

Some releases come with new or changed models. Update your database to reflect this with:

```shell
python /home/allianceserver/myauth/manage.py migrate
```

Finally, some releases come with new or changed static files. Run the following command to update your static files' folder:

```shell
python /home/allianceserver/myauth/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

Always restart AA, Celery and Gunicorn after updating:

```shell
supervisorctl restart myauth:
```
